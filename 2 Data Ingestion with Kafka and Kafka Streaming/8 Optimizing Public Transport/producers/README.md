# Optimizing Public Transportation - Producers Documentation

## Overview

This project simulates the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) "L" system, producing synthetic event data for stations, trains, turnstiles, and weather. The simulation is designed to generate realistic data streams for use with Kafka, Kafka Connect, and related streaming technologies.

## Key Components

### 1. **simulation.py**

- **Purpose:** Orchestrates the simulation, advancing time, and triggering all registered producers (weather, train lines, etc.).
- **Main Class:** `TimeSimulation`
  - Loads station data.
  - Initializes train lines (blue, red, green).
  - Runs the simulation loop, advancing time, producing weather and train events, and sleeping between steps.
- **Entry Point:** Running this file starts the simulation.

### 2. **connector.py**

- **Purpose:** Configures a Kafka Connect JDBC Source Connector to ingest station data from a Postgres database.
- **Key Function:** `configure_connector()`
  - Checks if the connector exists.
  - If not, creates it with the appropriate configuration (incrementing mode, polling every 5 minutes, etc.).

### 3. **logging.ini**

- **Purpose:** Sets up logging configuration for the simulation.

### 4. **requirements.txt**

- **Purpose:** Lists Python dependencies (confluent-kafka, pandas, requests).

## Data Directory

- **cta_stations.csv:** Station and stop metadata for the CTA system.
- **ridership_curve.csv:** Hourly ridership ratios for simulating realistic passenger flows.
- **ridership_seed.csv:** Average ridership numbers per station for weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays/holidays.
- **README.md:** Explains the data sources and their origins.

## Models Directory

### Core Classes

- **producer.py:**  
  - `Producer` base class: Handles Kafka topic creation, Avro producer setup, and common utilities.
- **line.py:**  
  - `Line`: Represents a train line (blue, red, green), manages stations and trains, and advances their state.
- **station.py:**  
  - `Station`: Represents a station, produces train arrival events, and manages a `Turnstile`.
- **train.py:**  
  - `Train`: Represents a train, tracks its status.
- **turnstile.py:**  
  - `Turnstile`: Produces turnstile entry events for a station.
- **turnstile_hardware.py:**  
  - `TurnstileHardware`: Simulates the hardware, calculates the number of entries based on ridership data and time.
- **weather.py:**  
  - `Weather`: Simulates weather events and produces them to Kafka via the REST Proxy.

### Schemas

- **schemas/**: Contains Avro schemas for all produced Kafka topics:
  - arrival_key.json, arrival_value.json: For train arrival events.
  - turnstile_key.json, turnstile_value.json: For turnstile entry events.
  - weather_key.json, weather_value.json: For weather events.

## Kafka Topics

Each producer emits events to a specific Kafka topic, using Avro schemas for serialization. Example topics:
- `org.chicago.cta.weather.v1`
- `org.chicago.cta.turnstile.v1`
- `org.chicago.cta.station.{station_name}.arrivals.v1`

## How the Simulation Works

1. **Initialization:**
   - Loads station and ridership data.
   - Sets up train lines and weather simulation.
   - Configures Kafka Connect for station data ingestion.

2. **Simulation Loop:**
   - Advances the simulation clock in steps (default: 5 seconds per step).
   - On each step:
     - Produces weather data (hourly).
     - Advances trains along each line, producing arrival events.
     - Simulates turnstile entries at each station.

3. **Kafka Integration:**
   - Each event is serialized using Avro and sent to the appropriate Kafka topic.
   - Topics are created automatically if they do not exist.

4. **Shutdown:**
   - On exit, all producers are flushed and closed cleanly.

## Extending the Simulation

- **Add new lines or stations:** Update cta_stations.csv and adjust the simulation logic if needed.
- **Modify event schemas:** Update the Avro schema files in `models/schemas/`.
- **Change simulation parameters:** Adjust time steps, ridership curves, or weather logic in the respective model classes.

## Running the Simulation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Start Kafka, Schema Registry, and Kafka Connect.**
3. **Run the simulation:**
   ```
   python simulation.py
   ```
4. **Monitor Kafka topics for produced events.**
